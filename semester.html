                <h2>Brief</h2>
                <p>An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on
                    items other users
                    have put up for auction.</p>
                <p>When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get
                    credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the
                    listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.</p>

                <h2>Requirements</h2>
                <p>All API functionality is managed by an existing application provided by Noroff. This project only covers the front-end application for
                    the API.</p>
                <p>The project also required a Gantt chart, prototype, style guide, kanban, github link and hosted application.</p>
